# Emotrics
Software to autmatically compute facial metrics in unilateral facial paralysis

Emotrics is a PyQt5 based application developed to facilitate the estimation of facial measurements in photographs. 
Emotrics works by automatically placing a 68 facial landmarks and using the position of those landmarks to 
estimate a set of facial measurements that can be used to asses facial symmetry and/or evaluate facial neurumuscular diseases. 
Moreover, results can be used to compare pre and post-procedure photographs to asses the effectiveness of treatment.
